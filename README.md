# Node.js Aardwolf MUD Client

## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Comments:
- test.js is just a blessed example
- v0.0.1 does login before going into the blessed gui
- index.js does everything in the gui, but can't actually send stuff back over the socket?
- net.js is trying a telnet server instead of connection, but this just fails to connect
