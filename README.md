# Node.js Aardwolf MUD Client
*Requires node version >= 12.0.0*
## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Inside the game
Regex can be a pain, so Aardwolf put in some helpful tags you can enable.

This client requires that you enable this tags manually for it to parse out map and inventory data.

Once in game, send these two commands:
```
tags inv on
tags map on
```
