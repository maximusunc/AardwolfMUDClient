# Node.js Aardwolf MUD Client
*Requires node version >= 12.0.0*
## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
If you want the old terminal client, run:
```bash
npm run start-old
```

## Inside the game
Regex can be a pain, so Aardwolf put in some helpful tags you can enable.

This client requires that you enable this tags manually for it to parse out map and inventory data.

```
invmon
tags map on
```
